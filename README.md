# Wordle Recreation
### Final Project for App Team Academy
#### By Jimmy Lynch

For our final project for App Team Academy we were asked to recreate a UI of any application we chose. I chose to recreate Wordle, as well as add some functionality to the application. It acts as regular wordle would, with 5 preset puzzles. 

Key concepts utilized include:
- NavigationStack and NavigationLink
- MVVM
- Functions

Features:
- Game win condition
- The word must be valid to be submitted
- Deactivates letters if not in the word and was attemppted to be used
- Visually denotes correct, incorrectly placed, and invalid letters

Improvement reflection:
- Better stylize win condition & loss condition
- Add a settings and stats page
- Make puzzle random from a set bank of words
- If a letter is used only once, it won't say it exists multiple times if used repeatedly.
